# Hi there, I'm Emnet :wave:

I am a recent full-stack web development graduate from Codaissure Code Academy.
I am currently working on two projects, my personal profile website and a collaborative [web-shop-app](https://github.com/katerynapidhorna/cake-shop) project with [Kate](https://github.com/katerynapidhorna) and [Demi](https://github.com/demi-werkzam).
